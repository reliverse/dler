## Installation

```bash
bun add @reliverse/dler
```

## Documentation

Visit [docs.reliverse.org/libraries/dler](https://docs.reliverse.org/libraries/dler) to learn how to install and use `@reliverse/dler` library.

## Declaration Generation

Dler uses Rslib's recommended approach for TypeScript declaration generation, supporting both bundled and bundleless declarations.

### Optional Dependencies

For advanced declaration generation features, you can install these optional dependencies:

```bash
# For bundled declarations (single .d.ts file per package)
bun add -D @microsoft/api-extractor

# For experimental tsgo support (faster generation)
bun add -D @typescript/native-preview
```

### Configuration

Configure declaration generation in your `dler.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    global: {
      dts: {
        enable: true,
        bundle: false, // Bundleless by default
        abortOnError: true,
      },
    },
    packages: {
      "my-library": {
        dts: {
          bundle: true, // Bundled declarations
          distPath: "types",
        },
      },
      "my-other-package": {
        dts: {
          tsgo: true, // Use experimental tsgo
          bundle: false,
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Contributing

A Bun monorepo created with the monorepo bootstrapper.

## Getting Started

bun install
```

## Workspaces

This monorepo was generated by dler init. It uses bun workspaces to manage multiple packages.

### Scripts

Run scripts across all workspaces:

```bash
bun --filter '*' <script>
```

Run scripts for specific packages:

```bash
bun --filter <package-name> <script>
```
