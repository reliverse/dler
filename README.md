# ðŸ§¬ Dler

> **@reliverse/dler** is an open-source CLI & framework which helps developers build TypeScript/JavaScript libraries and CLI tools easily. It provides ready-to-use primitives, so you don't have to write them from scratch.

## CLI Installation

```bash
# install as a dev dep:
bun add -D @reliverse/dler
# or, install globally:
bun i -g @reliverse/dler
```

## CLI Usage

```bash
# when installed as a dev dep:
bun dler [command] [options]
# when installed globally:
dler [command] [options]
```

## Framework Installation

Both CLI and framework packages work independently, you're not required to install both.

```bash
bun add @reliverse/dler-logger
```

## Framework Usage

```ts
import { logger } from "@reliverse/dler-logger";
logger.success("Hello, Reliverse!"); // > âœ“ Hello, Reliverse!
```

## Available Packages

1. `@reliverse/dler-bump`
2. `@reliverse/dler-build`
3. `@reliverse/dler-config`
4. `@reliverse/dler-helpers`
5. `@reliverse/dler-colors`
6. `@reliverse/dler-mapper`
7. `@reliverse/dler-launcher`
8. `@reliverse/dler-logger`
9. `@reliverse/dler-matcher`
10. `@reliverse/dler-pkg-tsc`
11. `@reliverse/dler-prompt`
12. `@reliverse/dler-spinner`
13. `@reliverse/dler-publish`

## Available CLI Commands

All `@reliverse/dler` v2+ commands support both monorepo (recommended) and single-repo (not tested too much yet) contexts.

1. `dler build` can build packages as libraries, frontends (experimental), or standalone apps (experimental; already includes Bun, so the user doesn't even need to install it). Handles not only building, but also package.json modification, and other build-related tasks. Supports dler.ts configuration for per-package settings.
2. `dler clean` nicely cleans up the codebase, with presets and with support for custom paths.
3. `dler init` automatically generates a monorepo and the requested packages.
4. `dler integrate` automatically installs and configures integrations like Next.js, Ultracite/Biome, etc.
5. `dler perf` runs performance benchmarks for the requested target.
6. `dler publish` publishes all packages to npm and jsr (soon). Handles version bumping, and different validations. Supports dler.ts configuration for per-package settings.
7. `dler shell` uses Bun's `$`, making it handy for running cross-platform custom terminal commands.
8. `dler tsc` finds TypeScript errors across all monorepo packages and shows only real ones (unlike the native `tsc`, which sometimes shows errors of its dependencies). It also has a `--copy-logs` flag that copies errors/warnings straight to your clipboard (with an inserted prompt for fixing them), so you can just hit Ctrl/Cmd+V and send it to AI.
9. `dler update` updates the dependencies of all packages to the latest version (yes, even across the monorepo).

## v2 Docs

Docs for v2 will be available soon. For now, you can read the v1 docs, or check alpha docs in [relidocs](./relidocs) directory in the root of the project. For example, you can [learn Dler CLI defaults](./relidocs/DEFAULTS.md) there.

## v1 Docs

Visit [docs.reliverse.org/libraries/dler](https://docs.reliverse.org/libraries/dler) to learn how to install and use `@reliverse/dler` library.

## Contributing

A Bun monorepo created with the monorepo bootstrapper.

## Getting Started

```bash
bun install
```

## Workspaces

This monorepo was generated by dler init. It uses bun workspaces to manage multiple packages.

## Locations

- `dler` (v2): `./cli`;
- `dler-v1`: `./deprecated` (contains both CLI and all-in-one library);
- packages: `./packages/*`;

### Scripts

Run scripts across all workspaces:

```bash
bun --filter '*' <script>
```

Run scripts for specific packages:

```bash
bun --filter <package-name> <script>
```
