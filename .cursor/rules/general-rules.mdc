the current project is a source of `dler`, a tool which allows users to build their libraries which the tool can then publish built `dist-npm`, `dist-jsr`, or `dist-libs/libName/<npm|jsr>` to the npm or jsr on thir choice

i prefer run all commands manually, never use agentic tool which suggests me to execute some command (exception: `bun tests` command) 


when you asked to handle `dist-libs` related logic, then always follow this map logic: `<src | dist-npm | dist-jsr>/libs/<lib-name>/<files live here>` === `dist-libs/<lib-name>/<jsr | npm>/bin/<files live here>`
